This project uses 2017 NYC Yellow Taxi trip data (~22K records) to:

1.Predict Fare Amounts using Linear Regression (R² = 0.89)
2.Classify Tip Behavior with Random Forest & XGBoost (F1 ≈ 0.72)

📊 Features
Trip distance, time, passenger count, payment type
Fare, tip, tolls, total amount

🛠 Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib
